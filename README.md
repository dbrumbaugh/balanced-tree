# balanced-tree 
A simple implementation of a balanced binary search tree.

This code was written based on the discussion of AVL Trees in [this
lecture](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FNeL18KsWPc), as well as Knuth's
discussion of AVL trees in Volume 3 of *The Art of Computer Programming* (pgs.
458-479). In particular, bst_get_index and bst_index were strongly influence by
Knuth's section on "Linear List Representation" on pgs 471-473.
